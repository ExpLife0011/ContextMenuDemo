# ContextMenuDemo

demonstration of IContextMenu.

Why use IContextMenu instead of IExecuteCommand? IMO mostly to 
afford control over the menu, like multiple items, 
disabling/enabling, custom drawing etc..

# Getting started

The meat of the shell extension is in the DisplayNamesCtxMenuShellExt.\* files. 
The rest is just ATL boilerplate stuff.
